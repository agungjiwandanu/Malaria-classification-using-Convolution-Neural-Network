Malaria is a disease caused by plasmodium that attacks red blood cells. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is often used in image classification. The data used is a segmented red blood cell image and is secondary data. Before training the data, data pre-processing and data addition from the dataset are performed. The number of layers is 4. The model testing accuracy is 86%. From the test results, it is found that the classification of red blood cells obtained is the same due to the smaller number of layers, which is only 4 layers.
